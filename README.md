#purpose
    I'm always wanting a simple little application for testing front-end components
    and find that I throw my code away and have to rebuild this little template every 
    time when I'm done.  So I thought, why not save this project so I, or anyone who wants a turnkey
    MEANJS app can use this?
    
#usage
1. clone https://github.com/iamsap/meanjs-quickstart.git
2. cd meanjs-quickstart
3. npm install
4. bower install
5. node server.js
6. begin prototyping
