#purpose
    I'm always wanting a simple little application for testing front-end components
    and find that I throw my code away and have to rebuild this little template every 
    time.  So I thought, why not save this in Github so I, or anyone who wants a turnkey
    MEANJS app can use this.
    
#usage
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. node server.js
5. begin prototyping
